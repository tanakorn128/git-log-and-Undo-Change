    <h1>InSight Is Meeting the Challenge of Winter on Dusty Mars</h1>
    <img src="img/img2.jpg" height="400" width="800">
    
    <p>As dust collects on the solar panels and winter comes to Elysium Planitia, 
        the team is following a plan to reduce science operations in order to keep the lander safe.</p>
    
    <p>NASA’s InSight lander recently received a mission extension for another two years, 
        giving it time to detect more quakes, dust devils, and other phenomena on the surface of Mars.
         While the mission team plans to continue collecting data well into 2022, 
         the increasing dustiness of the spacecraft’s solar panels and the onset of the Martian winter 
         led to a decision to conserve power and temporarily limit the operation of its instruments.</p>
